Charger Class adds a charger class to Terraria.

This Includes:
    25 Accessories
    43 Weapons
    10 Ammos
    3 Other Items

Charge Weapons charge up to increase crit chance, knockback and damage
Each player has a max charge that can be increased throughout the game
Each weapon also has charge levels that grant bonus effects.

For example, if the player has 1000 max charge,
and a charge weapon with charge levels of 300,
if the weapon is charged to 500,
it will do 50% total damage
and acitivate one charge effect
because 300 goes into 500 only once.

The charger class is a subclass of ranged weapon so effects will carry over

We are still working on sprites for items, projectiles, debuffs, ect...
There are also many balance issues/bugs that will be addressed when we can get to them.
This mod is still in its earliest stages of development so consider that.
The mod should work for the most part with multiplayer, but is not intended for it.
